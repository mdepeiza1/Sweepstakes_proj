Dependency Injection:

Dependency injection is occurring in the constructor public MarketingFirm(ISweepstakesManager manager) in the MarketingFirm class. 
The benefit is the type of Manager (stack or queue) does not need to be defined in the initial instantiation.
This allows the instantiation to be flexible.
The Marketing Firm can choose at instantiation whether the manager will be queue-based or stack-based.
